## Short summary

With right amount of pressure, we perform at the optimal level to achieve what we want. It is important to be mindful about not stressed while it is quite easy for a person with higher drive and too ambitious and high self-esteem. With correct techniques such as changing the way we think, applying mental imagery and changing our typical behavior and having SMART goals, we can alleviate our stress. Proper social connection, regular exercise, good time management and regularly leave time and space to relax are vital for healthy and stress free life


## Notes

**Stress: Excessive pressure than what one is capable of coping with a given situation.**

With the _**right**_ amount of pressure, we function in an _**optimal**_ way.

When the pressure is less, we become

- Underloaded
- Frustrated
- Bored
- Apathetic
- Depressed
- Rustout

When the pressure is more, we become

- Overloaded
- Irritable
- Anxious
- Fatigued
- Exhausted
- Burnout

+ We work best when stressed optimally
+ Long term stress can lead to various physical and mental health conditions and needs to be addressed.
+ Having an internal locus of control is best. Having a proactive approach rather than responding to external factors, triggers.

### Stress Model

The stress model is broken down into 6 stages
1. External pressure or life events
2. Perceived as stressful
3. Stress response: Physiological, behavioral & psychological
4. Reappraisal of situation
5. Stress responses failing to remove stress causing factor
6. Physical and / or psychological illness

Our negative perceptions, appraisals of a situation, not the situation itself may induce stress response.

Negative emotions can be helpful to manage a stressful situation and we should watch out for unhelpful emotions for different scenarios and choose the helpful emotions.

+ Threat or danger: Instead of feeling anxiety, helpful to feel concerned
	+ Unhelpful emotion: Anxiety
	+ Helpful emotion: Concern
+ Loss, failure: Instead of feeling depressed, helpful to feel sadness
	+ Unhelpful emotion: Depression
	+ Helpful emotion: Sadness
+ Breaking of moral code: Instead of feeling guilt, helpful to feel remorse
	+ Unhelpful emotion: Guilt
	+ Helpful emotion: Remorse
+ Breaking of personal rule: Instead of feeling damning anger, helpful to feel non-damning anger
	+ Unhelpful emotion: Damning anger
	+ Helpful emotion: Non-damning anger
+ Personal weakness revealed publicly: Instead of feeling shame, helpful to feel regret
	+ Unhelpful emotion: Shame
	+ Helpful emotion: Regret
+ Others betraying you: Instead of feeling hurt, helpful to feel disappointment
	+ Unhelpful emotion: Hurt
	+ Helpful emotion: Disappointment

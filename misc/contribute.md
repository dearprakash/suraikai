Hi and thank you for taking an interest in contributing to the Gatekeeper Wiki a project created for fans of this game by fans of this game.

The wiki is super easy to contribute to, it's actually just a collection of markdown files hosted on Github. 

# Edit a Page

On each page you'll see a "Edit on GitHub" button and if you click on it, you'll be taken to the file on GitHub where you can edit it and commit changes. Changes should be committed to a new branch (it will prompt) as changes directly to main will not be allowed. Once approved, your branch will be merged into main and the automation process will update the live site.

Note 1: Make sure your file ends in .md like filename.md

# Add a Page

To add a new page entirely instead of editing one, it's as simple as adding a file in the content folder, making sure to put the file in any subfolders it may need to (or creating said folder). You can do all this on the GitHub website.

All filenames should be accurately labeled and any needed spaces should be an underscore _ . All assets like image should go in content/assets properly organized.

Note 2: You'll need a GitHub account. 



You can find the [content folder here](https://github.com/Mondrethos/gatekeeperwiki/tree/main/content)

<!-- Make sure that the github edit button link is correct. This just means adding the parent and filename after the content folder in the URL -->

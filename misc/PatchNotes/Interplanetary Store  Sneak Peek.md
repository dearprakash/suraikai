# Interplanetary Store: Sneak Peek
Hello Gatekeepers!

  

We’ve been silent for a while, but for good reason! Our upcoming update will bring a wide range of significant changes, which we hope you’ll enjoy!

  

Prisms

Yes, the in-game currency, Prisms, is making a comeback.

  
**Quick reminder: Prisms are a currency you earn during a run. With it you can buy artifacts in obelisks.**  
  
In our opinion, the Infinity prism farming system was a little boring and uninspired. We’ve reworked this system and added several new ways of obtaining prisms:  

- Now gatekeepers recieve prisms from each killed enemy  
    
- Prisms no longer fall to the ground, and instead fly straight to the gatekeeper  
    
- Every location has randomly placed Spectrices, filled with prisms.

  

Obelisks

The choice of artifacts in obelisks has been increased to 1 of 3, granting gatekeepers more control over their builds. Now to obtain an artifact from an obelisk, you’ll need to spend an amount of prisms corresponding to its rarity.  
  
**But there are still some free options:**  

- In Normal Mode the number of Gift of Arcanum has been greatly reduced, but you can still encounter them. The random artifact from the Gift of Arcanum will still be obtainable for free.  
    
- After beating the Siren, an Obelisk of Catharsis will appear close by. This obelisk offers 1 of 2 free high rarity items to choose from.

  

Locations/Planets

**Locations have been greatly reworked. Most important change - the size.**  
  
New locations are 3-4 times bigger. Now players won’t be as pressured by enemies as before, having more time to recollect themselves and think over their artifact and level up choices  
  
In addition to this, we were able to get rid of loading screens in between locations. That’s because for each planet in a circle there is one location. In a circle there are 4 planets, which means 4 big locations.  
  
Due to the increased size of locations, we’ve reworked enemy spawning. Now the flow of battles will feel much more organic. And we’ve also added a **mini-map**!  
  
  

Siren Statues

![](https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/f9cd95f9897ea59e3904fe4ce2737da04e0a1d58.gif)  
**Now the Siren won’t show up until you want it to.**  
  
After completing the main objective of a location, the statue of the Siren will become interactible. You’ll recieve a new mission - Touch the Statue. Statues are always situated in the same places, so in time you’ll memorize where they are located.  
  
Activating the statue summons the Siren of the current planet to battle.  
  
Before activating a statue you can explore the location, farm prisms, or stock up in an obelisk.  
  
  

Conflict Altar

![](https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/167d9733414cc5eac1b9c87ac9da4fa3a3582fcf.gif)  
Sometimes in a location you can encounter a Conflict Altar. Activating these altars will summon a lot of powerful enemies.  
  
Upon victory, the altar will grant you a significant amount of prisms.  
  
  

Delta

![](https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/42755050/69d3ffe9ee326b76c94ac471ba23205488382390.gif)  
**The Quiet Bay — a new and important location.** On Delta time stands still.  
  
Here gatekeepers can collect themselves before moving on. Points of interest on Delta:  

- A guaranteed Forge.  
    
- A guaranteed Obelisk of Curse.  
    
- At least 5 altars with artifacts, which can be purchased for prisms.  
    
- A Shrine of Triads.

  

Triads

A completely new mechanic for us!

  
Triads are a combination of 3 artifacts, which immensely power-up some of those artifacts. A triad can be created within a Shrine of Triads.  
  
For example you assemble Triad of Scorch by combining Cannonade, HVC and Heat Concentrate.  
With this triad, each bounce of HVC’s chain lightning will set the affected enemies on fire.  
  
We hope this mechanic encourages experimenting with different builds and significantly increases replayability.  
  
  
  
_And this is just a part of the new features waiting for you in the upcoming update!_

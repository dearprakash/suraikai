Greetings Gatekeepers!  
  
Version **0.8.0.37** is now available for download.  
  
**Fixed:** Forge UI couldn't be closed after being opened twice.  
**Fixed:** After dying in the arena, clients were unable to use skills.  
**Fixed:** After transitioning to the next location, other players' gatekeepers could appear without animation.  
**Fixed:** If you die with the Forge UI open, it would carry over to the main menu.  
**Fixed:** Connection breakdown to the lobby from the lobby browser (UI disappearing).  
**Fixed:** Incorrect display of nicknames in the lobby chat.  
**Fixed:** Inability to obtain the "Unstoppable" achievement in some cases.  
**Fixed:** Breakdown of Lucid Ethel when the Mediator transitions to Ghostwalk mode.  
  
**Changed:** Minor adjustments to the health of the Doomed enemy. Additionally, the Doomed will now appear more frequently.  
**Changed:** More efficient Edge Detection method.  
  
We are very grateful for your feedback.  
**Don't forget to update to play multiplayer.**

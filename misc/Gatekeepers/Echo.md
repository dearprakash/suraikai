**Description:**

Echo, the embodiment of the sound element, was destined to serve the Creators from the beginning of his existence. For millennia, he fulfilled the will of Terranis, Vita, and Celesta, actively participating in the creation of the physical aspect of the universe.

When his service was no longer needed, the Creators condemned him to a new role, that of Gatekeeper, for such a powerful force must not be idle.

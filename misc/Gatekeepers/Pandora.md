**Description:**

Pandora has always been a talented mage, renowned for her combat skills. During the Second Universal War, her homeworld was attacked by the 'Ash Army' from the Palium planet. At the cost of her own life, Pandora created a dome that saved a significant part of Aureon from the invasion.

At the moment of her death, the Creators summoned her soul into the Nowhere, where they offered her a new destiny. They saw in her the strength and dedication that made her the perfect candidate for the role of Gatekeeper. Pandora agreed.

With her powerful abilities, she stands guard over the Heart of Time, ready to battle anyone who dares to approach it with evil intentions.

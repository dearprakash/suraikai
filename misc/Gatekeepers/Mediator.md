**Description:**

As Lord Crustad's blood shaman, the Mediator channeled his powers to aid the Void Empire in bloody battles. Death caught up with him at the hand of the Lord himself in the Second Universal War. However, instead of a path to Purgatory, he found himself in the Nowhere facing the Creators.

The Mediator, against his will, was given the opportunity to atone for his past. Since then, Chaos' favorite has used his abilities to protect the Temple of Time. His past remains a heavy burden, but now he serves the light, even though he is drawn to the darkness.
